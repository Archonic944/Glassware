    ⚫ die on shifting stages
    ✅ tnt goes toward enemy
    ⚫ varible jump height causes slash boost to cancel
    ✅ disable pin hitbox when hit ground
    ✅  pin boosts
    ⚫ movement is difficult (vertical)
    ⚫ deflected does not do damage to kettle
    ⚫ folower effect isnt communicated well
    ⚫ dont tie stuff to framerate
    ⚫ bat is just better than jump, make it only replenish after stage rather than touching ground
    ⚫ shaking or flash for champaign to telegraph exlode
    ⚫ make frog more original 
    ⚫ varible jump height cancles moment from slash
    ⚫ jack looks like spinning top 
    ⚫ arrow hitbox feels really small due to player hitbox
    ⚫ more stages that encurage X-axis 
    ⚫ beach bounce dont shoot towards mouse
    ⚫ champaign cap slower and or physics object
    ✅ item spawn anim solid circles are weird
