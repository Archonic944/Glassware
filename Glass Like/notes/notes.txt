general ==================================
	- tea doesnt look like tea
	- tea are lazer snipers and too hard
	- doesnt teach reset slash
	- turn off colison with tnt and player, prevent getting stuck
	- fall through plats
	- die on shifting stages
	- tnt goes toward enemy
	- varible jump height causes slash boost to cancel
	- disable pin hitbox when hit ground
	- pin boosts
	- movement is difficult (vertical)
	- deflected does not do damage to kettle
	- folower effect isnt communicated well
	- dont tie stuff to framerate
	- bat is just better than jump, make it only replenish after stage rather than touching ground
	- shaking or flash for champaign to telegraph exlode
	- make frog more original 
	- varible jump height cancles moment from slash
	- jack looks like spinning top 
	- arrow hitbox feels really small due to player hitbox
	- more stages that encurage X-axis 
	- beach bounce dont shoot towards mouse
	- champaign cap slower and or physics object
	- item spawn anim solid circles are weird
	- flowers small??
	- horozontal item placement makes it to pick up
	- boost when hit pin instead
	- player death animation doesnt consistantly knock 
	- foes are too static 

ideas ===================================
	- turret facing away that can only be hit behind (wert)
